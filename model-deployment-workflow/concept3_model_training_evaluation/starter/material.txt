parameter_tuning

1. Scikit-learn has several options for hyperparameter tuning in their documentation.
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#hyper-parameter-optimizers
2. Scikit-learn also has a great article on their site about tuning: Tuning the hyper-parameters of an estimator
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/grid_search.html
3. Hyperparameter search is not limited to the two mentioned in the video. For additional information check out: Hyperparameter Tuning in Python: a Complete Guide 2021
